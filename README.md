# Book Store Website

This project is a full-stack Book Store website that connects to MongoDB. It allows users to view books and categories (e.g., Best Seller and New) and enables an admin to manage the books (add, edit, and delete) through a secure interface.

## Overview

The Book Store Website is designed to display a collection of books that are stored in a MongoDB database. The project has two major components:

1. **User Interface:**  
   - Displays all books retrieved from the database.
   - Categorizes books as **Best Seller** (if marked by the admin) or **New**.

2. **Admin Interface:**  
   - **Admin Login:** Uses a static array to validate admin credentials.
   - **Book Management:**  
     - **Add Book:** Admin can add a new book using a form.
     - **Edit & Delete Book:** After login, the admin is provided with a table-based dashboard where each row (book) has options to edit or delete the book.

---

## Features

- **Live Project:** The project is hosted on Render with the domain: 
    https://book-store-guuf.onrender.com/


- **CRUD Operations:**  
- Create: Add new books.
- Read: View the list of all books.
- Update: Edit book details.
- Delete: Remove books from the database.
- **Book Categorization:**  
- Books can be tagged as **Best Seller** (if the admin marks them) or show up under **New** if not.
- **Secure Admin Access:**  
- Admin login is implemented using static credentials (editable in the code).

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js and Express (assumed based on the structure)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, BootStrap and JavaScript (for both the user and admin interfaces)
- **Hosting:** Render

---

## System Architecture

1. **Database Layer:**  
 MongoDB stores all the book data with fields such as name, price, author, description, and a Boolean flag for Best Seller.

2. **Server/API Layer:**  
 The backend server exposes RESTful API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the book data.

3. **Client Layer:**  
 - **User Side:** Displays book lists fetched via the API.
 - **Admin Side:** Provides forms and a table dashboard for managing book data.
